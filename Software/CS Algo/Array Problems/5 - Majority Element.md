Find the array that occurs more than N/2 times in the array, if it exists

Idea
- if an elements occurs more than N/2, counting the rest of the elements combined will sum to less than N/2.
- If we loop and keep a counter for each variable we see, the majority element will always be left with a positive counter
- The Majority Element will get at least N/2 + 1 votes, and at most N/2 downvotes, so it will be left at the end as candidate


```
auto votes_balance = 1;
auto majority_candidate = a[0];
for (auto i = 1; i < n; ++i)
{
	auto val = a[i];
	if (val == majority_candidate)
	{
		++votes_balance;
	}
	else 
	{
		--votes_balance;
		if (votes == 0)
		{
			majority_candidate = val;
			votes_balance = 1;
		}
	}
}
```
Why is this Correct?
- a non majority element will receive **at most** `V < N/2` votes in total
- in the worst case, the majority element will cancel `V` votes but will still get at least one more vote making it the majority candidate.
