Insights:
If we are in position i, the best sum that ends at position i - 1 can either:
1. help me get a better sum (if it is positive)
2. make it worse for me (if it is negative), and hence we might prefer starting over

We sum each element, if the sum becomes negative, then it is better to discard it and start over since this continuous part only worsen things
