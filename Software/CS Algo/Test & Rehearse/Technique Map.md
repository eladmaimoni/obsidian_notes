## Two Pointers - 2 Ends Variant

#### Problems
- [[30 - Two Sum - Sorted Array]]
- [[10 - Container With The Most Water]]
- [[12 - 3Sum]]
- 
#### When Used? 
- find a combination of 2 elements that fit a certain criteria

####  Correctness
- We always have 2 Choices - move end or start
- A lot of time, depending on the situation, there is only one logical move to do.
- The Induction move is to ask - if I move the wrong pointer, can this improve my situation?
- In a lot of cases, the answer is NO, and hence it is as if we already checked ALL the combinations after / before this pointer.

## Two Pointers - Mutual Start
#### Problems 
- [[1 - Subarray Sum - target subarray sum (non negative values)]]
- dgds
- dfgsd
- sfg
#### When Used?
