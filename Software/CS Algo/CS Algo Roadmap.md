### Plan Outline
1. Phase 1: Shallow understanding of techniques
   Solve the most popular medium problems on each subject (geekforgeeks)
	- [ ] 50 array 
	- [ ] 20 strings
	- [ ] 10 linked list
	- [ ] 20 graph
2. Phase 2: Deeper pattern understanding
   - Go through all the problems you've solved
   - Solve them again
   - Classify them according to **pattern** and **technique** used
   - **Deep understanding** of each solution
   - Visualize the solution in your mind, not just code
3. Phase 3: Fortify the data structures and algorithm
   Make sure you understand and know how to implement the following
   - [ ] Heap / Heap sort
   - [ ] Binary Sort
   - [ ] Binary Search Tree
   - [ ] BFS
   - [ ] DFS
   - [ ] AVL Tree / Red Black Tree
   - [ ] 
1. Start with 50 med array problems
2. Every 10 problems - repeat the ones you already do
3. When going through problems again, try to think about possible use cases for them
