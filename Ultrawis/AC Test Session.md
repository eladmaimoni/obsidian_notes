### Primary Goals:
1. Gateworks:
   - Hit `D` key on the screen to show communication stats
   - keep track of communication between cranes and report back how many communication loss did you witness
2. Trolley Noise:
   - After installation of the new power supply, test to see if noise issue is resolved.
   - Check noise with movement and without movement
3.  make sure all sensors are properly calibrated

4. Sensors accuracy test
 
2. Test gateworks communication stability (Hit `D` Key to view stats) - mainly keep track of communication loss during the experiment and report back.
3. Trolly Calibration And Stability Checking (noise)
4. 
5. Accurate calibration procedure for all sensors
   - Slew - in case it is not calibrated, calibrate by position
   -
