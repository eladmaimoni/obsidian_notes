- Circa 2016 back when it was inside elbit sys
- Developed or at least co developed most of the software architecture and features
- including hardware, algorithms such as Toric IOL alignment, GPU programming and optimization, graphics
- Work alongside Roy, Michael, Ran, Eran

Issues
- Bloat, whether its too much hardware for too many displays and too many surgeons
- HW bloat, people bloat (but this was after my time)
- over reliance on HW
- I wa always very much in favour of SW based solution
- HW is much more complex, requires much more effort, time, bugs are expensive to fix

Hi Burton,

I went over the document, here are a few thoughts.

As you know, I see a lot of cons in committing to a full scale implementation by a contractor. 

- Communication barrier is a real 

- I think it is crucial to speak with actual TechFlex clients that can share their experience. I think this is crucial before committing .
- 
- There are a few aspects of the beyeonics system that  
1. I would do a thorough analyses of existing beyeonics 1.0 features and capability and try to map them to the beyeonics 2.0. changing the existing setup (no reliance on digital zoom)
   for instance, I can think 
2. I would divide the project based on different milestones. 

### Phase 1 - Pre planning and prototyping
Goals:
- model the jetson 
   phase 1 - prototyping
   - this phase should have in par ima
