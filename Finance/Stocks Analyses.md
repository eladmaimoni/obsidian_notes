### Profitability
1. **Net Income** - total income after taxes and expances
2. **Preferred Dividends** - There are preferred shareholders (that gets more of the earnings I guess) and common shareholders - like me
3. **EPS - Earnings Per Share**
   - Assuming I hold a single share, how much profit the company has made per share.
   - $EPS = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Total Shares}}$ 
   - The higher the value - the better
4. P/E Ratio
   - the total earnings per share does not account for the share price
   - It does not tell you how profitable that amount of money you invest in a company is
